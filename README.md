| PHP | [README](https://github.com/Dheirya/RockPaperScissorsIn10Langs/php/) | ```php -S localhost:port``` |

**Disclaimer:** I am not a pro at most of these languages. In fact, for most of these languages, it's the first time I've used them, so the code is probably not the best and there might be bugs. Luckily, this is open source, meaning if you find a bug or have a suggestion,  just raise a PR :)

And yeah, that's about it... just rock paper scissors shoot in a bunch of languages. Well this is awkward... maybe leaving a star would help?
